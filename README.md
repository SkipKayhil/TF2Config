TF2Config
=========

These are the config files I use to play TF2. They include simple things such as enabling raw_input and disabling mouse acceleration and also some more complex things like weapon based crosshairs and disabling viewmodels for certain classes.

I also use HUDas Iscariote as my HUD, which can be found at: http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/8719-hud-hudas-iscariote-first-beta-release (also at eft2l, but this one is more actice)
