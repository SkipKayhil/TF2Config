Skipped's TF2 Configs
=====================

These are the config files I use to play TF2. They include simple things such as enabling raw_input and disabling mouse acceleration and also some more complex things like weapon based crosshairs and disabling viewmodels for certain classes.

I also use HUDas Iscariote as my HUD, which can be found at: http://teamfortress.tv/forum/thread/8719-hud-hudas-iscariote-first-beta-release (also at eft2l, but this one is more active with updates)

How to use
----------
You can download the zipped files on the right. 

###Extract the Config files to want to use to:
#####1. Old Location: 
`$steam$/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg` 
(where $steam$ is your Steam installation folder)

#####2. New Location: 
`$steam$/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom/$name$/cfg`
(where $steam$ is Steam installation, $name$ can be whatever you want to name your folder in custom )

While the new location is probably much easier for managing which configs you are using, I still use the original location for my CFGs.

###Chris' FPS Configs
I have included the remainder of Chris' fps configs. Unfortunately, he is not actively updating them, but they still work really well for me. To change which config is being used, go into autoexec.cfg and change the first line to the name of the one you want.

Example: `exec _highframes.cfg`

You can also go into one of Chris' configs and use the launch options listed there. (I recommend it)

**PLEASE REMEMBER TO REMOVE THE DXLEVEL COMMAND AFTER YOU HAVE LAUNCHED TF2 ONCE WITH IT**

Not removing the -dxlevel command can cause with multiplayer and the store among other things.
